# SOPS configuration for homelab secrets
# path_regex matches the INPUT file (the plaintext file being encrypted).
# Any file under secrets/ will be encrypted with the age public key below.
#
# One-time setup:
#   1. Generate an age key: age-keygen -o ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt
#   2. Copy the "public key: age1..." line from ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt
#   3. Replace the placeholder below with your actual public key
#   4. Store the private key (~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt) securely — never commit it
#
# For CI (GitHub Actions), add the full content of ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt
# as the repository secret: SOPS_AGE_KEY
